# Color Utility for Unity

A semi-handy little class for creating nice, matching colors in Unity - Triad Colors, Complementary, Analogous etc

I used this class a lot for both *"Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love"* and *"Hell is a Mountain Flower".*

General usage...

* Drop the folder / class into your project.
* Pass a base color and a few arguments to any of the nicely-commented functions (e.g: GetAnalogousColors)
* Get an array of colors for that color strategy in return
* Easy

A few convenience functions are in there too - mainly for comparing colors, for deciding if a color is "pretty much" black, and so forth.

And now... Here are some screenshots of the thing... applied... in real life. (Semi-real life).

*"Hell is a Mountain Flower"* - the game color progression. I used a base set of colors to set the "tone" of each area, and applied some variation and the color strategies (analogous, triad, complementary) to fill in the blanks and add some... surprise and delight.

Randomness is hard, man. Randomness isn't always _pretty_. Controlled randomness. That's what God is after. I imagine.

*"Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love"* - a little development / patchwork scene showing a handful of dynamic palettes, propagated up to some scenery (in this case... trees), with some nice and subtle ground color variation.

*"Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love"* again - this time... the game proper, all stretched out over a sphere (aren't we all?). It's got a kind of... viral propagation of color palettes going on. Each living entity has its own color, each entity drops colors that match, and they kind of... eat each other's colors, mix them, and so forth. Living paint, right?
